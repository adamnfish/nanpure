# Dev Notes

## TODO

* slightly larger font?
* make space for thick borders
* arrow navigation for selected square
* grid status border
* options for displaying errors
* option for highlighting 'completed' cells? (r/c/s)

Outside this app

* find real example puzzles
* page around this for obtaining puzzles
  - probably via server-side calls


DONE
* centre numbers more accurately
* change selection colour to yellow (green for valid)
* check for puzzle completion
* mobile-friendly number input
